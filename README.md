# naz-portfolio-site
A fully custom personal portfolio website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a Node.js backend. Designed to showcase my professional work at Immigration Canada, academic projects, daily productivity workflows (Notion &amp; Excel), and hobbies. Deployed with GitHub Pages and backend hosted on Render.
